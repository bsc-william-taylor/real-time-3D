# Real Time 3D

The real time 3D module taught basic 3D graphics using a industry standard graphics library and programming language. Students learn the theoretical underpinnings of 3D graphics - from elementary viewing to scene graphs, gain a basic understand of contemporary graphics hardware. It is assessed with a practical coursework where students develop a 3D demo and demo it both to fellow students and module lectures.

## Assignment

Using C++ and OpenGL students were to produce a 3D tech demo in which a player can conrtol an animated character around a 3D, lit, environment. Along with the assessment the following elements were mandatory for a basic pass.

* Software design document
* Software project report
* User instructions
* Resonable coding standard.
* Use object oriented code

For the best marks students were expected to implement the following.

* Terrain
* Collision detection
* Animation
* 2D/3D Sound
* Minimap
* Dynamic lighting

## Submission

I submitted a 3D city demo written in C++ using OpenGL that had the following features.

* Animated models
* Full city model
* Collisions auto generated from models
* Post processing
* UI for various settings.
* Minimap
